		There are two catogories in this game you can either be a crewmate or an imposter. The job of the imposter is to kill everyone in the ship or sabotage and they win. The crewmates have limited time to catch the imposter among them and eject them from their spaceship. There is no unmuting and muting in this game. So you have to type in the inbuild chat box. But we can start a discord to discuss. With constant stuggle of finding the imposter, who are sused or lieing, it always brings new statergies and plan to find the imposter. The challenge of finding who is lying and who are actually telling the truth brings chaos and fun to this game.
